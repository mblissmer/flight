# flying
I'm using this project to learn Love2D and Lua. It is a work in progress and is most likely several different types of broken, and probably not really a "game" yet. Once it turns into something real, I'll probably leave the source code here, since with the Love2D engine, it's not like you couldn't crack it open and take a look anyway.

Any external libraries have been excluded, and must be added to a 'libs' folder.

At the moment, those libraries are:
/libs/hc = [hardon collider](https://vrld.github.io/HardonCollider/index.html) (for collisions)
/libs/hump = [hump](https://github.com/vrld/hump)hump (gamestates, timers, tweening, etc)
/libs/gooi = [gooi](https://github.com/tavuntu/gooi)gooi (UI)
